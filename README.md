# KindleHighlights

Problem statement: "How to improve the retention of content that I read from books?"

Solution: 
Iteration 1: Can I build something that will take all my kindle highlights(10,000s of them) as input, and randomly pick 10 of the highlights and send out a mail?
Ideas: 

Iteration 2: Can I let anyone cut a PR on the repo with their mail-id and so that they can also receive daily mails?

Iteration 3 : Can I tag the highlights and group them together, so that it is easier to get back to them?

Open for more idea:

Current Status:
- Iteration1 -- Done
- Iteration2 -- Inprogress
- Interation3 -- ToDo
