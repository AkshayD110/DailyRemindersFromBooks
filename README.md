# KindleHighlights

Problem statement: "How to improve the retention of content that I read from books?"

Solution:  
Iteration 1: Can I build something that will take all my kindle highlights(10,000s of them) as input, and randomly pick 10 of the highlights and send out a mail?  
Ideas: use calibre to get kindle highlights, python smpt client, gitaction to run a cron daily 

Iteration 2: Can I let anyone cut a PR on the repo with their mail-id and so that they can also receive daily mails?

Iteration 3 : Can I tag the highlights and group them together, so that it is easier to get back to them?

Iteration 4 : Automate the process of getting highlights from Kindle to the git repo.
Selfnote: Organize the repo better.
