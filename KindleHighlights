The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win. (Location 474)

When subordinates aren’t doing what they should, leaders that exercise Extreme Ownership cannot blame the subordinates. They must first look in the mirror at themselves. The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute. (Location 479)

Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept, and taking ownership when things go wrong requires extraordinary humility and courage. But doing just that is an absolute necessity to learning, growing as a leader, and improving a team’s performance. (Location 488)

“That might be one of the issues: in your mind you are doing everything right. So when things go wrong, instead of looking at yourself, you blame others. But no one is infallible.

In virtually every case, the SEAL troops and platoons that didn’t perform well had leaders who blamed everyone and everything else—their troops, their subordinate leaders, or the scenario. They blamed the SEAL training instructor staff; they blamed inadequate equipment or the experience level of their men. They refused to accept responsibility. Poor performance and mission failure were the result. (Location 575)

The answer: leadership is the single greatest factor in any team’s performance. Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader. The leader’s attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance—or doesn’t. And this applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to the junior leaders of teams within the team. (Location 727)

My boat crew at times had struggled to perform, until I figured out that I had to put myself in the most difficult position at the front of the boat and lead. (Location 732)

Looking back, I could have yelled a lot less and encouraged more. (Location 738)

With a culture of Extreme Ownership within the team, every member of the team could contribute to this effort and ensure the highest levels of performance. (Location 748)

When setting expectations, no matter what has been said or written, if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable—if there are no consequences—that poor performance becomes the new standard. Therefore, leaders must enforce standards. (Location 802)

Consequences for failing need not be immediately severe, but leaders must ensure that tasks are repeated until the higher expected standard is achieved. Leaders must push the standards in a way that encourages and enables the team to utilize Extreme Ownership. (Location 803)

Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mind-set into the team. (Location 814)

The best teams anywhere, like the SEAL Teams, are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher. It starts with the individual and spreads to each of the team members until this becomes the culture, the new standard. (Location 816)

Is the goal of enlightenment to see and love this world exactly as it is, or to see through it, to something beyond?

‘Have you seen the snow leopard?’ ‘No, isn’t that wonderful!’ Even a materialist can take comfort in this rejection of hubris, in its acceptance of the world-as-it-is, with its own priorities, and not always the world as we want it to be.

one understands why “village life” has been celebrated as the natural, happy domain of man by many thinkers from Lao-tzu to Gandhi.

In a warm sun children play, and women roll clothes on rocks at the village fountain and pound grain in stone mortars, and from all sides come reassuring dung smells and chicken clatter and wafts of fire smoke from the low hearths.

that man’s existence is inseparable from sorrow; that the cause of suffering is craving; that peace is attained by extinguishing craving; that this liberation may be brought about by following the Eight-fold Path: right attention to one’s understanding, intentions, speech, and actions; right livelihood, effort, mindfulness; right concentration, by which is meant the unification of the self through sitting yoga.

A true experience of prajna corresponds to “enlightenment” or liberation—not change, but transformation—a profound vision of his identity with universal life, past, present, and future, that keeps man from doing harm to others and sets him free from fear of birth-and-death.

“Man is the matter of the cosmos, contemplating itself,”

O, how incomprehensible everything was, and actually sad, although it was so beautiful. One knew nothing. One lived and ran about the earth and rode through forests, and certain things looked so challenging and promising and nostalgic: a star in the evening, a blue harebell, a reed-green pond, the eye of a person or a cow. And sometimes it seemed that something never seen yet long desired was about to happen, that a veil would drop from it all; but then it passed, nothing happened, the riddle remained unsolved, the secret spell unbroken, and in the end one grew old and looked cunning . . . or wise . . . and still one knew nothing perhaps, was still waiting and listening.

And another day, she asked me shyly what would happen if she should have a miraculous recovery—would we love each other still, and stay together, or would the old problems rise again to spoil things as before? I didn’t know, and that is what I said. We had tried to be honest, and anyway, D would not have been fooled. I shrugged unhappily, she winced, then we both laughed. In that moment, at least, we really understood that it didn’t matter, not because she was going to die but because all truth that mattered was here now.

“free life” as described by a mountaineer: “The mountains had been a natural field of activity where, playing on the frontiers of life and death, we had found the freedom for which we were blindly groping and which was as necessary to us as breath.”

I am not here to seek the “crazy wisdom”; if I am, I shall never find it. I am here to be here, like these rocks and sky and snow, like this hail that is falling down out of the sun.

Wonderfully, Jang-bu laughed aloud, as did Dawa and Phu-Tsering, although it meant wet clothes and a wet sleeping bag for the head sherpa. That happy-go-lucky spirit, that acceptance which is not fatalism but a deep trust in life, made me ashamed. October 27 IN THE STONE fall of this canyon, my tent is pitched at a sharp angle, with bedroll pinched among sharp rocks.

Phu-Tsering’s awestruck face, so like a child’s, reminds me of GS’s story of the time in eastern Nepal when our cook received a letter saying that his wife had left him for another man. Weeping, Phu-Tsering had got to his feet and read the letter aloud to all the Sherpa villagers where they were camped, and the people had all stood there and wept with him. As GS commented, “A Westerner would have slunk off and kicked stones; you have to admire the sherpas for being so open about everything”—so open, so without defence, therefore so free, true Bodhisattvas, accepting like the variable airs the large and small events of every day.

Snow mountains, more than sea or sky, serve as a mirror to one’s own true being, utterly still, utterly clear, a void, an Emptiness without life or sound that carries in Itself all life, all sound.

Days and months are the travellers of eternity. So are the years that pass by. . . . I myself have been tempted for a long time by the cloud-moving wind—filled with a strong desire to wander. . . . I walked through mists and clouds, breathing the thin air of high altitudes and stepping on slippery ice and snow, till at last through a gateway of clouds, as it seemed, to the very paths of the sun and moon, I reached the summit, completely out of breath and nearly frozen to death. Presently the sun went down and the moon rose glistening in the sky.

“The power of such a mountain is so great and yet so subtle that, without compulsion, people are drawn to it from near and far, as if by the force of some invisible magnet; and they will undergo untold hardships and privations in their inexplicable urge to approach and to worship the centre of this sacred power. . . . This worshipful or religious attitude is not impressed by scientific facts, like figures of altitude, which are foremost in the mind of modern man. Nor is it motivated by the urge to ‘conquer’ the mountain. . . .”2

The secret of the mountains is that the mountains simply exist, as I do myself: the mountains exist simply, which I do not. The mountains have no “meaning”, they are meaning; the mountains are.

Perhaps she knows better than to think at all, but goes simply about the business of survival, like the wolf; survival is her way of meditation.

“Of course I am happy here! It’s wonderful! Especially when I have no choice!”

The purpose of meditation practice is not enlightenment; it is to pay attention even at unextraordinary times, to be of the present, nothing-but-the-present, to bear this mindfulness of now into each event of ordinary life. To be anywhere else is “to paint eyeballs on chaos”.20 When I watch blue sheep, I must watch blue sheep, not be thinking about sex, danger, or the present, for this present—even while I think of it—is gone.

leap free of gravity, as I do so often these days in my dreams—was that no more than pure relief at crossing the last high pass? If so, how sad it seems to celebrate the end of precious days at Crystal Mountain. Perhaps I left too soon; perhaps a great chance has been wasted; had I stayed at Shey until December, the snow leopard might have shown itself at last. These doubts fill me with despair. In worrying about the future, I despoil the present; in my escape, I leave a true freedom behind.

The second reporter decides that if he’s just going to do one article this week, he’d better make it count.

He spends two days researching it and another couple days writing it and checking facts.

**Note:** importnce of quality along with quantity

Principle 1: By setting limitations, we must choose the essential. So in everything you do, learn to set limitations.

Principle 2: By choosing the essential, we create great impact with minimal resources. Always choose the essential to maximize your time and energy.

Will this have an impact that will last beyond this week or this month? How will it change my job, my career, my life? How will this further a long-term goal of mine? How important is that goal?

Which areas of my life are overwhelming? What would I like to simplify? In addition to the tasks I need to accomplish in different areas, do I want to limit the number of possessions I have, what information I receive, or what responsibilities I have?

Principle 3: Simplifying—Eliminating the Nonessential

Principle 4: Focus is your most important tool in

In these days of instant technology, we are bombarded with an overload of information and demands of our time. But we’re not designed to

Principle 5: Create new habits to make long-lasting improvements.

Set your 3 MITs (Most Important Tasks) each morning. Single-task. When you work on a task, don’t switch to other tasks. Process your in-box to empty. Check e-mail just twice a day. Exercise five to ten minutes a day. Work while disconnected, with no distractions. Follow a morning routine. Eat more fruits and veggies every day. Keep your desk decluttered. Say no to commitments and requests that aren’t on your Short List (see Chapter 13, Simple Commitments). Declutter your house for fifteen minutes a day.

Stick to a five-sentence limit for e-mails.

Principle 6: Start new habits in small increments to ensure success.

The key to the MITs for me: At least one of the MITs should be related to one of my goals. While the other two can be work stuff (and usually are), one must be a goal action. This ensures that I am doing something to move my goals forward that day.

Successful, effective people are those who launch directly into their major tasks and then discipline themselves to work steadily and single-mindedly until those tasks are complete.

Clarity is perhaps the most important concept in personal productivity.

Step one: Decide exactly what you want.

Step two: Write it down.

Take action on your plan immediately. Do something. Do anything.

Step seven: Resolve to do something every single day that moves you toward your major goal.

You may have heard of the Six-P Formula. It says, “Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance.”

Make your list the night before for the workday ahead.

Start with the end in mind and work backward.

This means that if you have a list of ten items to do, 20 Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything 21 two of those items will turn out to be worth five or ten times or

Before you begin work, always ask yourself, “Is this task in the top 20 percent of my activities or in the bottom 80 percent?”

Rule: Resist the temptation to clear up small things first.

**Note:** but if it takes less than 10mins, then it should be fine

Successful people have a clear future orientation. They think five, ten, and twenty years out into the future.

Before starting on anything, you should always ask yourself, “What are the potential consequences of doing or not doing this task?”

“There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing.”

“What is the most valuable use of my time right now?”

Plan your daily workload in advance. Single out the relatively few small jobs that absolutely must be done immediately in the morning. Then go directly to the big tasks and pursue them to completion.

Review your work list right now and put an A, B, C, D, or E next to each task or activity. Select your A-1 job or project and begin on it immediately.

Here is one of the greatest questions you will ever ask and answer: “What one skill, if I developed and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on my career?”

90 percent of the value that you contribute to your company is contained in those three tasks, whatever they are.

Upgrading your skills is one of the most important personal productivity principles of all. Learn what you need to learn so that you can do your work in an excellent fashion. The better you become at eating a particular

Continually ask yourself these key questions:“What am I really good at? What do I enjoy the most about my work?

Identify your most important goal in life today. What is it? What one goal, if you achieved it, would have the greatest positive effect on your life? What one career accomplishment would have the greatest positive impact on your work life?

“Why haven’t I reached it already? What is it in me that is holding me back?”

Only about 2 percent of people can work entirely without supervision. We call these people “leaders.” This is the kind of person you are meant to be and that you can be, it you decide to be.

The standards you set for your own work and behavior should be higher than anyone else could set for you.

Make it a game with yourself to start a little earlier, work a little harder, and stay a little later. Always look for ways to go the extra mile, to do more than you are paid

Most of your emotions, positive or negative, are determined by how you talk to yourself on a minute-to-minute basis.

Refuse to complain about your problems. Keep them to yourself. As speaker-humorist Ed Foreman says, “You should never share your problems with others because 80 percent of people don’t care about them anyway, and the other 20 percent are kind of glad that you’ve got

tell them, “If it is really important, someone will tell you.” If something important happens at home, at work, in the country, or in the world, someone else can spend hours following the news for you, and he or she will usually tell you on the first possible occasion.

Think continually of different ways that you can save, schedule, and consolidate large chunks of time. Use these times to work on important tasks with the most significant long-term consequences.

In the final analysis, nothing will help you more in your career than for you to get the reputation for being the kind of person who gets important work done quickly and well. This reputation will make you one of the most

And that was the irony: in the wake of his failure at school, time was one thing he had plenty of.

Sometimes, as Ramanujan sat or squatted on the pial, he’d look up to watch the children playing in the street with what one neighbor remembered as “a blank and vacant look.” But inside, he was on fire.

Inauspicious incidents, however, marred the wedding. While Ramanujan and Janaki, in the finest silk sari her family could afford, sat together on the traditional swing being serenaded by singers, the screams of a retarded girl from town shattered the moment’s harmony. At another point, a garland Janaki sought to place around Ramanujan’s neck fell to the ground. Finally, as drummers and musicians entertained them, a fire broke out in a corner of the choultry where the wedding was being held. Though quickly extinguished, it was deemed an ill omen.

“Nowadays,” somebody said later, “there are only three really great English mathematicians: Hardy, Littlewood, and Hardy-Littlewood.”

Sylvester Medal

**Note:** mathematical medal

This was not exactly a lie, but it wasn’t the whole truth either. Hardy had more in mind than getting Ramanujan the right books to read. He had made Neville the instrument of his plan. He had deputized him to bring Ramanujan to England.

Something more was needed—something, at least for public consumption, beyond his mother’s merely human will, or Ramanujan’s. Neville learned what it was: “In a vivid dream his mother had seen [Ramanujan] surrounded by Europeans and heard the goddess Namagiri commanding her to stand no longer between her son and the fulfillment of his life’s purpose.”

Proof is no mere icing on the cake. Take the sequence of integers 31, 331, 3331, 33331, 333331, 3333331. Each is a prime number.

a2 = ab Add a2 − 2ab to both sides of the equation: a2 + (a2 − 2ab) = ab + (a2 − 2ab) Which reduces to: 2(a2 − ab) = a2 − ab

Next day, Ramanujan was back in Cambridge. “I felt hurt and insulted when the ladies didn’t take the food I served,” he told Chatterji. “I did not want to come [back] in while they were in the house.” He had needed to get as far away, as fast as he could; with the money in his pocket, that was Oxford.

“Oh,” he replied when asked later why he’d not helped, “were we introduced?”

Laurence Young, the son of two mathematical contemporaries of Hardy and Littlewood at Cambridge,

**Note:** check on this

Mathematicians say that the number of partitions of 4 is 5. Or, p(4) = 5

And that, if anything, was just the problem. Hardy was in many ways the best and truest friend Ramanujan ever had. He was considerate, loyal, and kind to him. And yet in at least one way, unintentionally, he probably did Ramanujan harm. For in the ardent hopes he had for him, in his unbridled wish to see that he lived up to his potential—in keeping him to the mark, driving him—Hardy only fed Ramanujan’s addiction.

Seven decades later, Janaki, eighty-eight years old, was a stooped old woman, living in Triplicane, Madras, with her forty-five-year-old adopted son, Narayanan,

he tried to kill himself.

Around 1948, Janaki began taking care of a small boy, Narayanan, whose mother was in the hospital and who himself suffered from typhus. She visited him in the hospital, nursed him there, brought him books for school. Later, both his parents died, and Narayanan went to live with her. When she couldn’t both take care of him and support herself as a seamstress, he briefly left to attend a residential school. But when he was about fifteen, he came back to live with her for good, and she adopted him as her son.

She appeared in a British television special about Ramanujan, Letters from an Indian Clerk, later shown in America as well. In

When in November 1968, on receiving the Srinivasa Ramanujan Medal of the Indian National Science Academy, S. Chandrasekhar revealed that Ramanujan had tried to commit suicide, his comments sparked a furor. “I was shocked and surprised,”

By 1946, he was virtually an invalid. Snow pictured him as “physically failing, short of breath after a few yards’ walk.” His sister came to nurse him (though the Trinity rules were so strict that she had to leave his rooms at night).

It was soon. Hardy died on December 1, 1947, the day he was to be presented the Copley Medal.

“Take cars,” I said. I said it in this very quiet voice. “Take most people, they’re crazy about cars. They worry if they get a little scratch on them, and they’re always talking about how many miles they get to a gallon, and if they get a brand-new car already they start thinking about trading it in for one that’s even newer.

But is philosophy stagnant? Science seems always to advance, while philosophy seems always to lose ground. Yet this is only because philosophy accepts the hard and hazardous task of dealing with problems not yet open to the methods of science—problems like good and evil, beauty and ugliness, order and freedom, life and death; so soon as a field of inquiry yields knowledge susceptible of exact formulation it is called science.

Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement.

**Note:** Truth!

philosophy is the highest music.

Philosophy begins when one learns to doubt—

Plato complains that whereas in simpler matters—like shoe-making—we think only a specially-trained person will serve our purpose, in politics we presume that every one who knows how to get votes knows how to administer a city or a state.

Human behavior, says Plato, flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and knowledge.

Desire, appetite, impulse, instinct—these are one; emotion, spirit, ambition, courage—these are one; knowledge, thought, intellect, reason—these are one. Desire has its seat in the loins; it is a bursting reservoir of energy, fundamentally sexual. Emotion has its seat in the heart, in the flow and force of the blood; it is the organic resonance of experience and desire. Knowledge has its seat in the head; it is the eye of desire, and can become the pilot of the soul.

First then, our young Elite must learn to think clearly. For that purpose they shall study the doctrine of Ideas.

What Plato lacks above all, perhaps, is the Heracleitean sense of flux and change: he is too anxious to have the moving picture of this world become a fixed and still tableau.

Aristotle had spent money lavishly in the collection of books

if we go to him for entertainment we shall sue for the return of our money.

may at all events be sure that Aristotle is the spiritual author of all these books that bear his name: that the hand may be in some cases another’s hand, but that the head and the heart are his.

He rejects Empedocles’ doctrine that all organs and organisms are a survival of the fittest,23 and Anaxagoras’ idea that man became intelligent by using his hands for manipulation rather than for movement; Aristotle thinks, on the contrary, that man so used his hands because he had become intelligent.24 Indeed, Aristotle makes as many mistakes as possible

As human dissection was not practised in his time, he is particularly fertile in physiological errors: he knows nothing of muscles, not even of their existence; he does not distinguish arteries from veins; he thinks the brain is an organ for cooling the blood; he believes, forgivably, that man has more sutures in the skull than woman; he believes, less forgivably, that man has only eight ribs on each side; he believes, incredibly, and unforgivably, that woman has fewer teeth than man.25 Apparently his relations

Prudens quæstio dimidium scientiæ—to know what to ask is already to know half.

Everything in the world is moved by an inner urge to become something greater than it is.

Essentially the form of art is an imitation of reality; it holds the mirror up to nature.44 There is in man a pleasure in imitation, apparently missing in lower animals.

Now the peculiar excellence of man is his power of thought; it is by this that he surpasses and rules all other forms of life; and as the growth of this faculty has given him his supremacy, so, we may presume, its development will give him fulfilment and happiness.

The golden mean, however, is not, like the mathematical mean, an exact average of two precisely calculable extremes; it fluctuates with the collateral circumstances of each situation, and discovers itself only to mature and flexible reason. Excellence is an art won by training and habituation: we do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have these because we have acted rightly; “these virtues are formed in man by his doing the actions”;50 we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit: “the good of man is a working of the soul in the way of excellence in a complete life; . . . for as it is not one swallow or one fine day that makes a spring, so it is not one day or a short time that makes a man blessed and happy.”

greed which is the source of aristocratic ease and charm.

When everybody owns everything nobody will take care of anything.

Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life.

Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.

Frankl would have argued that we are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose how we will respond.

Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run—in the long run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of

“There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.” An

Only then did I spot the guard at my side who was using his stick. At such a moment it is not the physical pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as much as to punished children); it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all.

What did the prisoner dream about most frequently? Of bread, cake, cigarettes, and nice warm baths.

shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow prisoner, who threw himself about in his sleep, obviously having a horrible nightmare. Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffered from fearful dreams or deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man. Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake him, frightened at the thing I was about to do. At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him.

Then, after minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, “How beautiful the world could be!”

It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds. I

No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.

On returning to his house the master himself met Death, and questioned him, “Why did you terrify and threaten my servant?” “I did not threaten him; I only showed surprise in still finding him here when I planned to meet him tonight in Teheran,” said Death.

We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer suffcient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.

The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most diffcult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a diffcult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.

“Life is like being at the dentist. You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.” Varying

It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future—sub

Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.

“He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,”

We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.

I said that someone looks down on each of us in diffcult hours—a friend, a wife, somebody alive or dead, or a God—and he would not expect us to disappoint him. He would hope to find us suffering proudly—not miserably—knowing how to die.

to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.

Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.

We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate

In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.

“our current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.”

In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.

While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time.

The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man’s ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.

Everywhere means nowhere.

When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment.

so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself.

For it is not boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, – boyishness.

All you need to do is to advance; you will thus understand that some things are less to be dreaded, precisely because they inspire us with great fear.

Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die.

One needs no silver plate, encrusted and embossed in solid gold; but we should not believe the lack of silver and gold to be proof of the simple life.

“Cease to hope,” he says, “and you will cease to fear.”

Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring bane to us; for memory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them. The present alone can make no man wretched.

And why can it not happen? Because in such cases men know that they have all things in common, especially their troubles.

“What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself.” That was indeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone. You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind. Farewell.

But both courses are to be avoided; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you. Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve.

Your good qualities should face inwards.

“If you would enjoy real freedom, you must be the slave of Philosophy.”

There is this difference between ourselves and the other school: our ideal wise man feels his troubles, but overcomes them; their wise man does not even feel them.

He will have many masters who makes his body his master, who is over-fearful in its behalf, who judges everything according to the body.

One other thing: the Cream Soda Computer turned out to be the way I first met Steve Jobs. I was four years ahead of him in school so I didn’t know him; he was closer to Bill Fernandez’s age. But one day Bill told me, "Hey, there’s someone you should meet. His name is Steve.

You know, my dad had always told me that your job is the most important thing you’ll ever have and the worst thing to lose. I still think that way. My thinking is that a company is like a family, a community, where we all take care of each other. I never agreed with the normal thinking, where a company is more competition driven, and the poorest, youngest or most recently hired workers are always the first to go.

Alice and I were married two years later. And our marriage lasted just a little longer than my career at Hewlett-Packard, which is funny in a sad way. Because I thought both of those arrangements were going to last forever.

The whole thing used forty-five chips, and Steve paid me half the seven hundred bucks he said they paid him for it. (They were paying us based on how few chips I could do it in.) Later I found out he got paid a bit more for it—like a few thousand dollars—than

In my head, the guy who’d rather laugh than control things is going to be the one who has the happier life. That’s just my opinion. I figure happiness is the most important thing in life, just how much you laugh. The guy whose head kind of floats, he’s so happy. That’s who I am, who I want to be and have always wanted to be. And that’s why I never let stuff like

I was scared, but I showed up. And you know what? That decision changed everything. That night turned out to be one of the most important nights of my life.

but back then I was also just as busy: always working on projects, engineering for work and then engineering at home. I don’t feel like I’ve changed much since then, and I guess this proves it, sort of.

our engineering manager, to take a vacation for a week. And meanwhile he did some research. He went around and talked to every engineer in the company and found out who was doing what and who was working and who wasn’t doing much of anything. Then he fired a whole bunch of people. That was called Bloody Monday. Or, at least, that’s what it ended up being called in the Apple history books. I thought that, pretty much, he fired all the right ones. The laggards, I mean. And then Mike Scott himself

I would try this with other babies—these flying tours—and I found out that after about twenty minutes, I could do it with them, too. All babies were the same! All babies gave the same muscle signals. I loved that I had figured out a way to let Jesse choose what to explore, before he could even crawl or walk, without having to be totally dependent on someone else.

Most inventors and engineers I’ve met are like me—they’re shy and they live in their heads. They’re almost like artists. In fact, the very best of them are artists. And artists work best alone—best outside of corporate environments, best where they can control an invention’s design without a lot of other people designing it for marketing or some other committee. I don’t believe anything really revolutionary has ever been invented by committee. Because the committee would never agree on it!

In my entire life I’ve only seen about one in twenty engineers who really exemplify that artistic perfection. So it’s pretty rare to make your engineering an art, but that’s how it should

The only thing we could absolutely rely upon had to do with Moore’s Law—the now-famous rule in electronics (named for Intel founder Gordon Moore) that says that every eighteen months you can pack twice the number of transistors on a chip.

They are usually achievers and can show results, but this is because they are effective in selling their ideas and themselves inside the company as well as outside the company.

If you're an employee you must figure out a way to let the true decisionmakers know how good you really are, without making enemies of the people in between.

If you alienate your peers, you won't need any other corporate enemies.

Within the company, you are also more likely to be 'found out. Your real self is likely to emerge, and your weaknesses as well as your strengths are likely to be discovered. As a result, you must realize that 'you get along by getting along.

Don't be predictable. You don't want to give someone above you the opportunity to say, 'So-and-so is up to his old tricks again

When I first shook hands with Arnold Palmer, I told him I could make only two guarantees. First, that if I didn't know something, I would tell him. Second, that when I didn't know something, I would find someone who did.

The inability of people to say 'I don't know', even in innocent social situations, can give you an insight into their business character. I really do enjoy watching these people squirm sometimes as they try to bluff their way through conversations.

We have an executive who insists on being the 'Lone Arranger'. He won't bring in a deal, or involve & anyone else in it, until he has it totally wrapped up, because he is afraid he won't get all the credit. On several occasions both he and the company would have been far better off if he had asked for help and used some of the talent available to him,

But acting in a way that sacrifices corporate interest for self-interest limits your effectiveness and will be noted

It is not the mistake itself but how a mistake is handled that forms the lasting impression.

If you do have another job offer, but would like to remain with ie company you work for, stress the importance of your loyalty.
Instead of saying, 'Look, they've offered me this. Either match it or top it or I'm out the door, find out how much more effective it is to use slightly different words: "Obviously, this is where my loyalties lie, and what can the company do so that I don't have to take the other job?"

And like it or not, your boss is judging you by these three criteria:
COMMITMENT
ATTENTION TO DETAIL
IMMEDIATE FOLLOW UP

It is important to know the system so that you can work through it.
Too many people spend too much time fighting against the system.
The best and brightest spend their time learning how to use it.

Again, see your peers as your allies, not as your competition.
If you can hitch your wagon to a few of your company's brightest stars, you will climb right up the ladder with them.

When you need something from another department, ask your self, 'What can I do to make it easier for them?'
Show people in other departments that you want to work with them

The quickest way to lose credibility is to rage about minor offences because of a build-up over major ones.
This is the corporate version of getting a divorce because your spouse squeezes toothpaste from the middle of the tube.

Your effectiveness in a company is directly proportionate to your ability to leverage yourself: How and where can I make the most impact in the least amount of time?'

Leverage your attendance at meetings and your appointments to committees.
Look for those where you can gain the most and avoid those where you can contribute the least. When I see the same face popping up at every meeting, I start to wonder when that particular executive has time to get anything else done.

The projects people take on which are not part of their day-to-day This is job description, which have not been assigned to them, are those ast maje projects for which people get the most credit and recognition.

Most positions in a company are three-quarters functional, meaning the set responsibilities and duties that came with it, and one-quarter personal style. The degree to which you can stretch this 25% is the degree by which you will stand out in your company.

If you win the battle you're probably going to lose the war. And the more right you are, the more damage it will probably do in the long run.

I write everything down, and since I put my notes where they will pop up again in the right place at the right time, once I have written something down I forget about it. The end result is that when I break from work, I break from work-related stress as well.

I find that I am redefining my job all the time, taking on new tasks, or constantly creating new challenges for myself. If I reach some goal, either personally or corporately, that goal immediately becomes a step in the learning process towards another more ambitious goal.

If you're bored it's your fault. You just aren't working hard enough at making your job interesting. It is also probably the reason you haven't been offered anything better.

The people who get ahead have a need, are driven to perform a task well, no matter what the task is or how mundane it may actually be. They bring to any job an attitude which actually transforms the job into something greater.
Carpenters who become contractors at one time had a need to drive a nail straighter and truer than else.
Waiters who end up owning restaurants were at one learn will learn anyone time very good waiters.

That's what I'd expect you to say and I don't like to hear what I expect. It would be much more interesting if you said that the Wynand papers are a contemptible dump heap of yellow journalism and all their writers put together aren't worth two bits."

he loved the house of Austen Heller. He stayed in the drafting room through evening after evening, alone with a sheet of paper and the thought of a cliff over the sea. No one saw his sketches until they were finished.

"Listen. Roark, won't you please listen?"

TIl listen if you want me to, Mr. Snyte. But I think I should tel you now that nothing you can say will make any difference.

If you don't mind that, I don't mind listening."

Snyte went on speaking for a long time and Roark listened, without objecting, explaining or answering.

"Im not joining the A.G.A."

"What do you mean, you're not joining? You're eligible now."

"Possibly."

"You'll be invited to join."

"Tell them not to bother."

"What!"

"You know, Peter, we had a conversation just like this seven years ago, when you tried to talk me into joining your fraternity at Stanton. Don't start it again."

"You won't join the A.G.A. when you have a chance to?"

I won't join anything, Peter, at any time."

"But don't you realize how it helps?"

"In what?"

"In being an architect."

I don't like to be helped in being an architect."

"You're just making things harder for yourself."

"I am."

Keating wondered why he should experience that sickening feeling of resentment; why he had come here hoping to find the story untrue, hoping to find Roark uncertain and willing to surrender. That feeling had haunted him ever since he'd heard the news about Roark; the sensation of something unpleasant that remained after he'd forgotten the cause. The feeling would come back to him, without reason, a blank wave of anger, and e would ask himself: now what the hell?-what was it I heard to day? Then he would remember: Oh, yes, Roark-Roark's opened his own office. He would ask himself impatiently: So what and know at the same time that the words were painful to face, and humiliating like an insult.

He saw Roark coming up the hill, and frowned. He had seen Roark only a week ago, and because these visits meant too much to both of them, neither wished the occasion to be too frequent.

"Well?" Cameron asked gruffly. "What do you want here again?"

"I have something to tell you."

"It can wait."

"I don't think so."

"Well?"

"I'm opening my own office. I've just signed for my first building."

“Howard," he said. "Look at it."

He held it between them.

"It doesn't say much. Only 'Howard Roark, Architect.' But it's like those mottoes men carved over the entrance of a castle and died for. It's a challenge in the face of something so vast and so dark, that all the pain on earth-and do you know how much suffering there is on earth?-all the pain comes from that thing you are going to face. I don't know what it is, I don't know why it should be unleashed against you. I know only that it will be. And I know that if you carry these words through to the end, it will be a victory, Howard, not just for you, but for something that should win, that moves the world-and never wins acknowledgment. It will vindicate so many who have fallen before you, who have suffered as you will suffer. May God bless you-or whoever it is that is alone to see the best, the highest possible to numan hearts. You're on your way into hell, Howard."

Roark had bought an old Ford and drove down to the job more often than was necessary. It was difficult to sit at a desk in his o fice, to stand at a table, forcing himself to stay away from the construction site.

Roark stood on the cliff, by the structure, and looked at the countryside, at the long, gray ribbon of the road twisting past along the shore. An open car drove by, fleeing into the country.

The car was overfilled with people bound for a picnic. There was a jumble of bright sweaters, and scarfs fluttering in the wind; a jumble of voices shrieking without purpose over the roar of the motor, and overstressed hiccoughs of laughter; a girl sat sidewise, her legs flung over the side of the car; she wore a man's straw nat slipping down to her nose and she yanked savagely at the Strings of a ukulele, ejecting raucous sounds, yelling "Hey!"

These people were enjoying a day of their existence; they were shrieking to the sky their release from the work and the burdens the days behind them: they had worked and carried the burdens in order to reach a goal-and this was the goal.

He looked at the car as it streaked past. He thought that there was a difference, some important difference, between the consciousness of this day in him and in them. He thought that he should try to grasp it. But he forgot. He was looking at a truck panting up the hill, loaded with a glittering mound of cut granite.

Heller, the fighter against compulsion, was baffled by Roark, a man so impervious to compulsion that he became a kind of compulsion himself, an ultimatum against things Heller could not define. Within a week, Heller knew that he had found the best friend he would ever have; and he knew that the friendship came from Roark's fundamental indifference. In the deeper reality of Roark's existence there was no consciousness of Heller, no need Tor Heller, no appeal, no demand. Heller felt a line drawn, which he could not touch; beyond that line, Roark asked nothing of him and granted him nothing.

Do you understand the difference? Your house is made by its own needs.

Those others are made by the need to impress. The determining motive of your house is in the house. The determining motive of the others is in the audience."

She scrubbed the floor of her room, she peeled potatoes, she bathed In a tin pan of cold water. She had never done these things beTore; she did them expertly. She had a capacity for action, a competence that clashed incongruously with her appearance. She did Hot mind this new background; she was indifferent to the slums as she had been indifferent to the drawing rooms.

If I found a job, a project, an idea or a person I wanted-I'd have to depend on the whole world. Everything has strings leading to everything else. We're all so tied together. We're all in a net, the net is waiting, and we're pushed into it by one single desire. You want a thing and it's precious to you. Do you know who is standing ready to tear it out of your hands? You can't know, it may be so involved and so far away, but someone is ready, and you're afraid of them all. And you cringe and you crawl and you beg nd you accept them-just so they'll let you keep it. And look at and whom you come to accept."

People meant very little to Mike, but their performance a great deal. He worshiped expertness of any kind. He loved his work passionately and had no tolerance for anything save for other single-track devotions. He was a master in his own field and he felt no sympathy except for mastery. His view of the world was simple: there were the able and there were the incompetent; he was not concerned with the latter. He loved buildings. He despised, however, all architects.

"If you want my advice, Peter," he said at last, "you've made a mistake already. By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don't you know what you want?

How can you stand it, not to know?"

"What if you found something you wanted?"

"I won't find it. I won't choose to see it. It would be part of that lovely world of yours. I'd have to share it with all the rest of you-and I wouldn't. You know, I never open again any great book I've read and loved. It hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were. Things like that can't be shared. Not with people like that."

"That's what I'd expect you to say and I don't like to hear what I expect. It would be much more interesting if you said that the Wynand papers are a contemptible dump heap of yellow journalism and all their writers put together aren't worth two bits.""

“A good person avoided luxuries, never threw food away, and patched up torn trousers instead of buying a new pair. Only kings and nobles allowed themselves to renounce such values publicly and conspicuously flaunt their riches.”

“The flowering of the consumerist ethic is manifested most clearly in the food market. Traditional agricultural societies lived in the awful shade of starvation. In the affluent world of today one of the leading health problems is obesity, which strikes the poor (who stuff themselves with hamburgers and pizzas) even more severely than the rich (who eat organic salads and fruit smoothies). Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the hungry people in the rest of the world. Obesity is a double victory for consumerism. Instead of eating little, which will lead to economic contraction, people eat too much and then buy diet products – contributing to economic growth twice over.”

“In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding every penny. Today, the tables have turned. The rich take great care managing their assets and investments, while the less well heeled go into debt buying cars and televisions they don’t really need.”

“The supreme commandment of the rich is ‘Invest!’ The supreme commandment of the rest of us is ‘Buy!”

“most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions”

“and organic growth. Most societies were unable to make precise time measurements, nor were they terribly interested in doing so. The world went about its business without clocks and timetables, subject only to the movements of the sun and the growth cycles of plants. There was no uniform working day, and all routines changed drastically from season to season. People knew where the sun was, and watched anxiously for portents of the rainy season and harvest time, but they did not know the hour and hardly cared about the year”

“modern industry cares little about the sun or the season. It sanctifies precision and uniformity. For example, in a medieval workshop each shoemaker made an entire shoe, from sole to buckle. If one shoemaker was late for work, it did not stall the others. However, in a modern footwear-factory assembly line, every worker mans a machine that produces just a small part of a shoe, which is then passed on to the next machine. If the worker who operates machine no. 5 has overslept, it stalls all the other machines.”

“Today, a single affluent family generally has more timepieces at home than an entire medieval country. You can tell the time by looking at your wristwatch, glancing at your Android, peering at the alarm clock by your bed, gazing at the clock on the kitchen wall, staring at the microwave, catching a glimpse of the TV or DVD, or taking in the taskbar on your computer out of the corner of your eye. You need to make a conscious effort not to know what time it is”

“In an old-fashioned medieval community, when my neighbour was in need, I helped build his hut and guard his sheep, without expecting any payment in return. When I was in need, my neighbour returned the favour. At the same time, the local potentate might have drafted all of us villagers to construct his castle without paying us a penny. In exchange, we counted on him to defend us against brigands and barbarians. Village life involved many transactions but few payments. There were some markets, of course, but their roles were limited. You could buy rare spices, cloth and tools, and hire the services of lawyers and doctors. Yet less than 10 per cent of commonly used products and services were bought in the market. Most human needs were taken care of by the family and the community.”

“The market shapes to an ever-greater degree the way people conduct their romantic and sexual lives. Whereas traditionally the family was the main matchmaker, today it’s the market that tailors our romantic and sexual preferences, and then lends a hand in providing for them – for a fat fee. Previously bride and groom met in the family living room, and money passed from the hands of one father to another. Today courting is done at bars and cafés, and money passes from the hands of lovers to waitresses. Even more money is transferred to the bank accounts of fashion designers, gym managers, dieticians, cosmeticians and plastic surgeons, who help us arrive at the café looking as similar as possible to the markets ideal of beauty.”

“The two most important examples for the rise of such imagined communities are the nation and the consumer tribe. The nation is the imagined community of the state. The consumer tribe is the imagined community of the market. Both are imagined communities because it is impossible for all customers in a market or for all members of a nation really to know one another the way villagers knew one another in the past.”

“Nations existed in the distant past, but their importance was much smaller than today because the importance of the state was much smaller. A resident of medieval Nuremberg might have felt some loyalty towards the German nation, but she felt far more loyalty towards her family and local community, which took care of most of her needs”

“national communities have been increasingly eclipsed by tribes of customers who do not know one another intimately but share the same consumption habits and interests, and therefore feel part of the same consumer tribe – and define themselves as such. This sounds very strange, but we are surrounded by examples. Madonna fans, for example, constitute a consumer tribe. They define themselves largely by shopping. They buy Madonna concert tickets, CDs, posters, shirts and ring tones, and thereby define who they are. Manchester United fans, vegetarians and environmentalists are other examples. They, too, are defined above all by what they consume. It is the keystone of their identity. A German vegetarian might well prefer to marry a French vegetarian than a German carnivore.”

Above point same are a bunch of Hindus getting together and fighting other religion together. Today a bunch of Indians fight against Pakistan. The "imagined community" which was Religion earlier, not it is Nations! This is a way of a bunch of people ruling over other. Group them together and give them a sense of community..

“Today, even a thirty-year-old can honestly tell disbelieving teenagers, ‘When I was young, the world was completely different.’ The Internet, for example, came into wide usage only in the early 1990s, hardly twenty years ago. Today we cannot imagine the world without it.”

“Was the late Neil Armstrong, whose footprint remains intact on the windless moon, happier than the nameless hunter-gatherer who 30,000 years ago left her handprint on a wall in Chauvet Cave? If not, what was the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing, coinage, empires, science and industry?”

“One interesting conclusion is that money does indeed bring happiness. But only up to a point, and beyond that point it has little significance. For people stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder, more money means greater happiness. If you are an American single mother earning $12,000 a year cleaning houses and you suddenly win $500,000 in the lottery, you will probably experience a significant and long-term surge in your subjective well-being.”

“However, if you’re a top executive earning $250,000 a year and you win $1 million in the lottery, or your company board suddenly decides to double your salary, your surge is likely to last only a few weeks”

“People who are diagnosed with chronic illness such as diabetes are usually depressed for a while, but if the illness does not get worse they adjust to their new condition and rate their happiness as highly as healthy people do”

“Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true irrespective of economic or even physical conditions”

“the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations. If you want a bullock-cart and get a bullock-cart, you are content. If you want a brand-new Ferrari and get only a second-hand Fiat you feel deprived. This is why winning the lottery has, over time, the same impact on people’s happiness as a debilitating car accident. When things improve, expectations balloon, and consequently even dramatic improvements in objective conditions can leave us dissatisfied”

“If happiness is determined by expectations, then two pillars of our society – mass media and the advertising industry – may unwittingly be depleting the globe’s reservoirs of contentment. If you were an eighteen-year-old youth in a small village 5,000 years ago you’d probably think you were good-looking because there were only fifty other men in your village and most of them were either old, scarred and wrinkled, or still little kids. But if you are a teenager today you are a lot more likely to feel inadequate. Even if the other guys at school are an ugly lot, you don’t measure yourself against them but against the movie stars, athletes and supermodels you see all day on television, Facebook and giant billboards.”

“If that’s the case, even immortality might lead to discontent. Suppose science comes up with cures for all diseases, effective anti-ageing therapies and regenerative treatments that keep people indefinitely young. In all likelihood, the immediate result will be an unprecedented epidemic of anger and anxiety.

Those unable to afford the new miracle treatments – the vast majority of people – will be beside themselves with rage. Throughout history, the poor and oppressed comforted themselves with the thought that at least death is even-handed – that the rich and powerful will also die. The poor will not be comfortable with the thought that they have to die, while the rich will remain young and beautiful for ever.”

“Human happiness conditioning systems also differ from person to person. On a scale from one to ten, some people are born with a cheerful biochemical system that allows their mood to swing between levels six and ten, stabilising with time at eight. Such a person is quite happy even if she lives in an alienating big city, loses all her money in a stock-exchange crash and is diagnosed with diabetes. Other people are cursed with a gloomy biochemistry that swings between three and seven and stabilises at five. Such an unhappy person remains depressed even if she enjoys the support of a tight-knit community, wins millions in the lottery and is as healthy as an Olympic athlete.”

“It is true that married people are happier than singles and divorcees, but that does not necessarily mean that marriage produces happiness. It could be that happiness causes marriage. Or more correctly, that serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin bring about and maintain a marriage. People who are born with a cheerful biochemistry are generally happy and content. Such people are more attractive spouses, and consequently they have a greater chance of getting married. They are also less likely to divorce, because it is far easier to live with a happy and content spouse than with a depressed and dissatisfied one. Consequently, it’s true that married people are happier on average than singles, but a single woman prone to gloom because of her biochemistry would not necessarily become happier if she were to hook up with a husband”

“Somebody born with an average of level five happiness would never dance wildly in the streets. But a good marriage should enable her to enjoy level seven from time to time, and to avoid the despondency of level three.”

“Compare a medieval French peasant to a modern Parisian banker. The peasant lived in an unheated mud hut overlooking the local pigsty, while the banker goes home to a splendid penthouse with all the latest technological gadgets and a view to the Champs-Elysées. Intuitively, we would expect the banker to be much happier than the peasant. However, mud huts, penthouses and the Champs-Elysées don’t really determine our mood. Serotonin does. When the medieval peasant completed the construction of his mud hut, his brain neurons secreted serotonin, bringing it up to level X. When in 2014 the banker made the last payment on his wonderful penthouse, brain neurons secreted a similar amount of serotonin, bringing it up to a similar level X. It makes no difference to the brain that the penthouse is far more comfortable than the mud hut. The only thing that matters is that at present the level of serotonin is X. Consequently the banker would not be one iota happier than his great-great-great-grandfather, the poor medieval peasant.”

“In Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel Brave New World, published in 1932 at the height of the Great Depression, happiness is the supreme value and psychiatric drugs replace the police and the ballot as the foundation of politics. Each day, each person takes a dose of ‘soma’, a synthetic drug which makes people happy without harming their productivity and efficiency. The World State that governs the entire globe is never threatened by wars, revolutions, strikes or demonstrations, because all people are supremely content with their current conditions, whatever they may be. Huxley’s vision of the future is far more troubling than George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Huxley’s world seems monstrous to most readers, but it is hard to explain why. Everybody is happy all the time – what could be wrong with that?”

“As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are not part of some divine cosmic plan, and if planet Earth were to blow up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its business as usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion”

“The other-worldly meanings medieval people found in their lives were no more deluded than the modern humanist, nationalist and capitalist meanings modern people find. The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral.”

“The problem, according to Buddhism, is that our feelings are no more than fleeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves. If five minutes ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are gone, and I might well feel sad and dejected. So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles”

“the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify.”

“Most people wrongly identify themselves with their feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes. When they feel anger, they think, ‘I am angry. This is my anger.’ They consequently spend their life avoiding some kinds of feelings and pursuing others. They never realise that they are not their feelings, and that the relentless pursuit of particular feelings just traps them in misery.”

“WERE, SAY, A SPANISH PEASANT TO HAVE fallen asleep in AD 1000 and woken up 500 years later, to the din of Columbus’ sailors boarding the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria, the world would have seemed to him quite familiar. Despite many changes in technology, manners and political boundaries, this medieval Rip Van Winkle would have felt at home. But had one of Columbus’ sailors fallen into a similar slumber and woken up to the ringtone of a twenty-first-century iPhone, he would have found himself in a world strange beyond comprehension. ‘Is this heaven?’ he might well have asked himself. ‘Or perhaps – hell?”

“Ancient traditions of knowledge admitted only two kinds of ignorance. First, an individual might be ignorant of something important. To obtain the necessary knowledge, all he needed to do was ask somebody wiser”

“There was no need to discover something that nobody yet knew. For example, if a peasant in some thirteenth-century Yorkshire village wanted to know how the human race originated, he assumed that Christian tradition held the definitive answer. All he had to do was ask the local priest”

“Second, an entire tradition might be ignorant of unimportant things. By definition, whatever the great gods or the wise people of the past did not bother to tell us was unimportant. For example, if our Yorkshire peasant wanted to know how spiders weave their webs, it was pointless to ask the priest, because there was no answer to this question in any of the Christian Scriptures. That did not mean, however, that Christianity was deficient. Rather, it meant that understanding how spiders weave their webs was unimportant. After all, God knew perfectly well how spiders do it. If this were a vital piece of information, necessary for human prosperity and salvation, God would have included a comprehensive explanation in the Bible.”

“The willingness to admit ignorance has made modern science more dynamic, supple and inquisitive than any previous tradition of knowledge. This has hugely expanded our capacity to understand how the world works and our ability to invent new technologies. But it presents us with a serious problem that most of our ancestors did not have to cope with. Our current assumption that we do not know everything, and that even the knowledge we possess is tentative, extends to the shared myths that enable millions of strangers to cooperate effectively.”

“Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility”

“A famous example is lightning. Many cultures believed that lightning was the hammer of an angry god, used to punish sinners.”

“Franklins empirical observations, coupled with his knowledge about the qualities of electrical energy, enabled him to invent the lightning rod and disarm the gods”

“Throughout history, societies have suffered from two kinds of poverty: social poverty, which withholds from some people the opportunities available to others; and biological poverty, which puts the very lives of individuals at risk due to lack of food and shelter. Perhaps social poverty can never be eradicated, but in many countries around the world biological poverty is a thing of the past”

“in many societies more people are in danger of dying from obesity than from starvation.”

“Even if killing death seems a distant goal, we have already achieved things that were inconceivable a few centuries ago. In 1199, King Richard the Lionheart was struck by an arrow in his left shoulder. Today we’d say he incurred a minor injury. But in 1199, in the absence of antibiotics and effective sterilisation methods, this minor flesh wound turned infected and gangrene set in. The only way to stop the spread of gangrene in twelfth-century Europe was to cut off the infected limb, impossible when the infection was in a shoulder. The gangrene spread through the Lionheart’s body and no one could help the king. He died in great agony two weeks later.”

“The average life expectancy jumped from around twenty-five to forty years, to around sixty-seven in the entire world, and to around eighty years in the developed world”

“Science is a very expensive affair. A biologist seeking to understand the human immune system requires laboratories, test tubes, chemicals and electron microscopes, not to mention lab assistants, electricians, plumbers and cleaners. An economist seeking to model credit markets must buy computers, set up giant databanks and develop complicated data-processing programs. An archaeologist who wishes to understand the behaviour of archaic hunter-gatherers must travel to distant lands, excavate ancient ruins and date fossilised bones and artefacts. All of this costs money. Hence government had to consciously decide where it has to invest. ”

“If Darwin had never been born, for example, we’d today attribute the theory of evolution to Alfred Russel Wallace, who came up with the idea of evolution via natural selection independently of Darwin and just a few years later. But if the European powers had not financed geographical, zoological and botanical research around the world, neither Darwin nor Wallace would have had the necessary empirical data to develop the theory of evolution. It is likely that they would not even have tried.”

“biologists from the same department, possessing the same professional skills, have both applied for a million-dollar grant to finance their current research projects. Professor Slughorn wants to study a disease that infects the udders of cows, causing a 10 per cent decrease in their milk production. Professor Sprout wants to study whether cows suffer mentally when they are separated from their calves. Assuming that the amount of money is limited, and that it is impossible to finance both research projects, which one should be funded?

There is no scientific answer to this question. There are only political, economic and religious answers. In today’s world, it is obvious that Slughorn has a better chance of getting the money. Not because udder diseases are scientifically more interesting than bovine mentality, but because the dairy industry, which stands to benefit from the research, has more political and economic clout than the animal-rights lobby.”

“Economics is a notoriously complicated subject. To make things easier, let’s imagine a simple example”

“What enables banks – and the entire economy – to survive and flourish is our trust in the future. This trust is the sole backing for most of the money in the world.”

“If credit is such a wonderful thing, why did nobody think of it earlier? Of course they did. Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed in all known human cultures, going back at least to ancient Sumer. The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future would be better than the present. They generally believed that times past had been better than their own times and that the future would be worse, or at best much the same. To put that in economic terms, they believed that the total amount of wealth was limited, if not dwindling.”

“The king of England might enrich himself, but only by robbing the king of France. You could cut the pie in many different ways, but it never got any bigger. Earlier. ”

“Over the last 500 years the idea of progress convinced people to put more and more trust in the future. This trust created credit; credit brought real economic growth; and growth strengthened the trust in the future and opened the way for even more credit. It didn’t happen overnight – the economy behaved more like a roller coaster than a balloon. But over the long run, with the bumps evened out, the general direction was unmistakable. Today, there is so much credit in the world that governments, business corporations and private individuals easily obtain large, long-term and low-interest loans that far exceed current income.”

“All this depends, however, on the rich using their profits to open new factories and hire new employees, rather than wasting them on non-productive activities. Smith therefore repeated like a mantra the maxim that ‘When profits increase, the landlord or weaver will employ more assistants’ and not ‘When profits increase, Scrooge will hoard his money in a chest and take it out only to count his coins.’ A crucial part of the modern capitalist economy was the emergence of a new ethic, according to which profits ought to be reinvested in production. This brings about more profits, which are again reinvested in production, which brings more profits, et cetera ad infinitum. Investments can be made in many ways: enlarging the factory, conducting scientific research, developing new products. Yet all these investments must somehow increase production and translate into larger profits. In the new capitalist creed, the first and most sacred commandment is: ‘The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.”

“The new capitalist elite is made up not of dukes and marquises, but of board chairmen, stock traders and industrialists. These magnates are far richer than the medieval nobility, but they are far less interested in extravagant consumption, and they spend a much smaller part of their profits on non-productive activities.”

“Over the last few years, banks and governments have been frenziedly printing money. Everybody is terrified that the current economic crisis may stop the growth of the economy. So they are creating trillions of dollars, euros and yen out of thin air, pumping cheap credit into the system, and hoping that the scientists, technicians and engineers will manage to come up with something really big, before the bubble bursts. Everything depends on the people in the labs. New discoveries in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology could create entire new industries, whose profits could back the trillions of make-believe money that the banks and governments have created since 2008. If the labs do not fulfil these expectations before the bubble bursts, we are heading towards very rough times”

“When kings fail to do their jobs and regulate the markets properly, it leads to loss of trust, dwindling credit and economic depression. That was the lesson taught by the Mississippi Bubble of 1719, and anyone who forgot it was reminded by the US housing bubble of 2007, and the ensuing credit crunch and recession”

“In a completely free market, unsupervised by kings and priests, avaricious capitalists can establish monopolies or collude against their workforces. If there is a single corporation controlling all shoe factories in a country, or if all factory owners conspire to reduce wages simultaneously, then the labourers are no longer able to protect themselves by switching jobs.”

“THE MODERN ECONOMY GROWS THANKS to our trust in the future and to the willingness of capitalists to reinvest their profits in production. Yet that does not suffice. Economic growth also requires energy and raw materials, and these are finite. When and if they run out, the entire system will collapse”

“Whenever a shortage of either has threatened to slow economic growth, investments have flowed into scientific and technological research. These have invariably produced not only more efficient ways of exploiting existing resources, but also completely new types of energy and materials.”

“One might have expected that such a prodigious effort would have exhausted the energy sources and raw materials available for vehicle production, and that today we would be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Yet the opposite is the case. Whereas in 1700 the global vehicle industry relied overwhelmingly on wood and iron, today it has at its disposal a cornucopia of new-found materials such as plastic, rubber, aluminium and titanium, none of which our ancestors even knew about. Whereas in 1700 carts were built mainly by the muscle power of carpenters and smiths, today the machines in Toyota and Boeing factories are powered by petroleum combustion engines and nuclear power stations. A similar revolution has swept almost all other fields of industry. We call it the Industrial Revolution.”

“The career of electricity was more startling yet. Two centuries ago electricity played no role in the economy, and was used at most for arcane scientific experiments and cheap magic tricks. A series of inventions turned it into our universal genie in a lamp. We flick our fingers and it prints books and sews clothes, keeps our vegetables fresh and our ice cream frozen, cooks our dinners and executes our criminals, registers our thoughts and records our smiles, lights up our nights and entertains us with countless television shows. Few of us understand how electricity does all these things, but even fewer can imagine life without it”

“people became obsessed with the idea that machines and engines could be used to convert one type of energy into another. Any type of energy, anywhere in the world, might be harnessed to whatever need we had, if we could just invent the right machine”

“Why are so many people afraid that we are running out of energy? Why do they warn of disaster if we exhaust all available fossil fuels? Clearly the world does not lack energy. All we lack is the knowledge necessary to harness and convert it to our needs. The amount of energy stored in all the fossil fuel on earth is negligible compared to the amount that the sun dispenses every day, free of charge”

“Chemists discovered aluminium only in the 1820s, but separating the metal from its ore was extremely difficult and costly. For decades, aluminium was much more expensive than gold. In the 1860S, Emperor Napoleon III of France commissioned aluminium cutlery to be laid out for his most distinguished guests. Less important visitors had to make do with the gold knives and forks.5 But at the end of the nineteenth century chemists discovered a way to extract immense amounts of cheap aluminium, and current global production stands at 30 million tons per year. Napoleon III would be surprised to hear that his subjects’ descendants use cheap disposable aluminium foil to wrap their sandwiches and put away their leftovers.”

“Even plants and animals were mechanised. Around the time that Homo sapiens was elevated to divine status by humanist religions, farm animals stopped being viewed as living creatures that could feel pain and distress, and instead came to be treated as machines. Today these animals are often mass-produced in factory-like facilities, their bodies shaped in accordance with industrial needs. They pass their entire lives as cogs in a giant production line, and the length and quality of their existence is determined by the profits and losses of business corporations. Even when the industry takes care to keep them alive, reasonably healthy and well fed, it has no intrinsic interest in the animals’ social and psychological needs (except when these have a direct impact on production).”

“Egg-laying hens, for example, have a complex world of behavioural needs and drives. They feel strong urges to scout their environment, forage and peck around, determine social hierarchies, build nests and groom themselves. But the egg industry often locks the hens inside tiny coops, and it is not uncommon for it to squeeze four hens to a cage, each given a floor space of about twenty-five by twenty-two centimetres. The hens receive sufficient food, but they are unable to claim a territory, build a nest or engage in other natural activities. Indeed, the cage is so small that hens are often unable even to flap their wings or stand fully erect”

“The tragedy of industrial agriculture is that it takes great care of the objective needs of animals, while neglecting their subjective needs.”

“Today in the United States, only 2 per cent of the population makes a living from agriculture, yet this 2 per cent produces enough not only to feed the entire US population, but also to export surpluses to the rest of the world.9 Without the industrialisation of agriculture the urban Industrial Revolution could never have taken place – there would not have been enough hands and brains to staff factories and offices.”

“For the first time in human history, supply began to outstrip demand. And an entirely new problem was born: who is going to buy all this stuff?”

“Most people throughout history lived under conditions of scarcity. Frugality was thus their watchword”

“Money is thus a universal medium of exchange that enables people to convert almost everything into almost anything else. Brawn gets converted to brain when a discharged soldier finances his college tuition with his military benefits. Land gets converted into loyalty when a baron sells property to support his retainers. Health is converted to justice when a physician uses her fees to hire a lawyer – or bribe a judge. It is even possible to convert sex into salvation, as fifteenth-century prostitutes did when they slept with men for money, which they in turn used to buy indulgences from the Catholic Church.”

“Since around 200 BC, most humans have lived in empires. It seems likely that in the future, too, most humans will live in one. But this time the empire will be truly global. The imperial vision of dominion over the entire world could be imminent”

“As the twenty-first century unfolds, nationalism is fast losing ground. More and more people believe that all of humankind is the legitimate source of political authority, rather than the members of a particular nationality, and that safeguarding human rights and protecting the interests of the entire human species should be the guiding light of politics. If so, having close to 200 independent states is a hindrance rather than a help. Since Swedes, Indonesians and Nigerians deserve the same human rights, wouldn’t it be simpler for a single global government to safeguard them?”

“Historians can speculate, but not provide any definitive answer”

“History cannot be explained deterministically and it cannot be predicted because it is chaotic”

“Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts”

“Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise. If the current price of oil is $90 a barrel, and the infallible computer program predicts that tomorrow it will be $100, traders will rush to buy oil so that they can profit from the predicted price rise. As a result, the price will shoot up to $100 a barrel today rather than tomorrow. Then what will happen tomorrow? Nobody knows”

“Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as viruses, live inside the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding off their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and sometimes even killing them”

“Game theory explains how in multi-player systems, views and behaviour patterns that harm all players nevertheless manage to take root and spread. Arms races are a famous example. Many arms races bankrupt all those who take part in them, without really changing the military balance of power. When Pakistan buys advanced aeroplanes, India responds in kind. When India develops nuclear bombs, Pakistan follows suit. When Pakistan enlarges its navy, India counters. At the end of the process, the balance of power may remain much as it was, but meanwhile billions of dollars that could have been invested in education or health are spent on weapons. Yet the arms race dynamic is hard to resist. ‘Arms racing’ is a pattern of behaviour that spreads itself like a virus from one country to another, harming everyone, but benefiting itself, under the evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction.”

“Myths and fictions accustomed people, nearly from the moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules. They thereby created artificial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called culture”

“Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in constant flux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics”

“Most people claim that their social hierarchy is natural and just, while those of other societies are based on false and ridiculous criteria. Modern Westerners are taught to scoff at the idea of racial hierarchy. They are shocked by laws prohibiting blacks to live in white neighbourhoods, or to study in white schools, or to be treated in white hospitals. But the hierarchy of rich and poor – which mandates that rich people live in separate and more luxurious neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities – seems perfectly sensible to many Americans and Europeans. Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family” Excerpt From Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind Yuval Noah Harari This material may be protected by copyright.

“Time and again people have created order in their societies by classifying the population into imagined categories, such as superiors, commoners and slaves; whites and blacks; patricians and plebeians; Brahmins and Shudras; or rich and poor. These categories have regulated relations between millions of humans by making some people legally, politically or socially superior to others.”

“Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become personally acquainted” “A modern Eliza working at a florist’s needs to know how much effort to put into selling roses and gladioli to the dozens of people who enter the shop each day. She can’t make a detailed enquiry into the tastes and wallets of each individual. Instead, she uses social cues – the way the person is dressed, his or her age, and if she’s not politically correct his skin colour. That is how she immediately distinguishes between the accounting-firm partner who’s likely to place a large order for expensive roses, and a messenger boy who can only afford a bunch of daisies.” Excerpt From Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind Yuval Noah Harari This material may be protected by copyright.

“American plantations in places such as Virginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had originated in Africa. Africans had acquired over the generations a partial genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenceless and died in droves. It was consequently wiser for a plantation owner to invest his money in an African slave than in a European slave or indentured labourer. Paradoxically, genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into social inferiority: precisely because Africans were fitter in tropical climates than Europeans, they ended up as the slaves of European masters!”

“However, two centuries of slavery meant that most black families were far poorer and far less educated than most white families. A black person born in Alabama in 1865 thus had much less chance of getting a good education and a well-paid job than did his white neighbours. His children, born in the 1880S and 1890s, started life with the same disadvantage – they, too, were born to an uneducated, poor family”

“You might think that people would gradually understand that these stigmas were myth rather than fact and that blacks would be able, over time, to prove themselves just as competent, law-abiding and clean as whites. In fact, the opposite happened – these prejudices became more and more entrenched as time went by. Since all the best jobs were held by whites, it became easier to believe that blacks really are inferior. ‘Look,’ said the average white citizen, ‘blacks have been free for generations, yet there are almost no black professors, lawyers, doctors or even bank tellers. Isn’t that proof that blacks are simply less intelligent and hard-working?’ Trapped in this vicious circle, blacks were”

“How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while forbidding others”

“Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other.”

“Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity. To use them differently than God intends is unnatural. But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well.”

“To make things less confusing, scholars usually distinguish between ‘sex’, which is a biological category, and ‘gender’, a cultural category. Sex is divided between males and females, and the qualities of this division are objective and have remained constant throughout history. Gender is divided between men and women (and some cultures recognise other categories). So-called ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ qualities are inter-subjective and undergo constant changes.”

“Sex is child’s play; but gender is serious business. To get to be a member of the male sex is the simplest thing in the world. You just need to be born with an X and a Y chromosome. To get to be a female is equally simple. A pair of X chromosomes will do it. In contrast, becoming a man or a woman is a very complicated and demanding undertaking. Since most masculine and feminine qualities are cultural rather than biological, no society automatically crowns each male a man, or every female a woman. Nor are these titles laurels that can be rested on once they are acquired. Males must prove their masculinity constantly, throughout their lives, from cradle to grave, in an endless series of rites and performances. And a woman’s work is never done – she must continually convince herself and others that she is feminine enough”

“Foragers were never obliged to handle large amounts of mathematical data. No forager needed to remember, say, the number of fruit on each tree in the forest. So human brains not adapt to storing and processing numbers” _this is why we don’t remember numbers easily

“When the amount of people and property in a particular society crossed a critical threshold, it became necessary to store and process large amounts of mathematical data. Since the human brain could not do it, the system collapsed. For thousands of years after the Agricultural Revolution, human social networks remained relatively small and simple”

Numbers are a form of partial script as you can’t write poetry or a novel out of it

“A person who wishes to influence the decisions of governments, organisations and companies must therefore learn to speak in numbers. Experts do their best to translate even ideas such as ‘poverty’, ‘happiness’ and ‘honesty’ into numbers (‘the poverty line’, ‘subjective well-being levels’, ‘credit rating’). Entire fields of knowledge, such as physics and engineering, have already lost almost all touch with the spoken human language, and are maintained solely by mathematical script”

“Writing was born as the maidservant of human consciousness, but is increasingly becoming its master. Our computers have trouble understanding how Homo sapiens talks, feels and dreams. So we are teaching Homo sapiens to talk, feel and dream in the language of numbers, which can be understood by computers.”

On why women are given less importance. Just a theory. “A woman, on the other hand, had no problem finding a man willing to impregnate her. However, if she wanted her children to provide her with grandchildren, she needed to carry them in her womb for nine arduous months, and then nurture them for years. During that time she had fewer opportunities to obtain food, and required a lot of help. She needed a man. In order to ensure her own survival and the survival of her children, the woman had little choice but to agree to whatever conditions the man stipulated so that he would stick around and share some of the burden”

'“Myths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone could have imagined. When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail’s pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth.”

“Cooperation’ sounds very altruistic, but is not always voluntary and seldom egalitarian. Most human cooperation networks have been geared towards oppression and exploitation. The peasants paid for the burgeoning cooperation networks with their precious food surpluses, despairing when the tax collector wiped out an entire year of hard labour with a single stroke of his imperial pen”

“All these cooperation networks – from the cities of ancient Mesopotamia to the Qin and Roman empires – were ‘imagined orders’. The social norms that sustained them were based neither on ingrained instincts nor on personal acquaintances, but rather on belief in shared myths.”

“but according to the Americans all people are equal, whereas according to the Babylonians people are decidedly unequal. The Americans would, of course, say that they are right, and that Hammurabi is wrong. Hammurabi, naturally, would retort that he is right, and that the Americans are wrong. In fact, they are both wrong. Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no objective validity.”

“We know that people are not equal biologically! But if we believe that we are all equal in essence, it will enable us to create a stable and prosperous society.’ I have no argument with that. This is exactly what I mean by ‘imagined order’. We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society. Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless mirages. Rather, they are the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate effectively.”

“How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined. You always insist that the order sustaining society is an objective reality created by the great gods or by the laws of nature. People are unequal, not because Hammurabi said so, but because Enlil and Marduk decreed it. People are equal, not because Thomas Jefferson said so, but because God created them that way. Free markets are the best economic system, not because Adam Smith said so, but because these are the immutable laws of nature.”

“You also educate people thoroughly. From the moment they are born, you constantly remind them of the principles of the imagined order, which are incorporated into anything and everything. They are incorporated into fairy tales, dramas, paintings, songs, etiquette, political propaganda, architecture, recipes and fashions. For example, today people believe in equality, so it’s fashionable for rich kids to wear jeans, which were originally working-class attire. In the Middle Ages people believed in class divisions, so no young nobleman would have worn a peasant’s smock. Back then, to be addressed as ‘Sir’ or ‘Madam’ was a rare privilege reserved for the nobility, and often purchased with blood. Today all polite correspondence, regardless of the recipient, begins with ‘Dear Sir or Madam’.”

“The ideal modern house is divided into many small rooms so that each child can have a private space, hidden from view, providing for maximum autonomy. This private room almost invariably has a door, and in many households it is accepted practice for the child to close, and perhaps lock, the door”

“The castle rarely contained private rooms for children (or anyone else, for that matter). The teenage son of a medieval baron did not have a private room on the castle’s second floor, with posters of Richard the Lionheart and King Arthur on the walls and a locked door that his parents were not allowed to open. He slept alongside many other youths in a large hall. He was always on display and always had to take into account what others saw and said. Someone growing up in such conditions naturally concluded that a man’s true worth was determined by his place in the social hierarchy and by what other people said of him.8”

“How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined. You always insist that the order sustaining society is an objective reality created by the great gods or by the laws of nature. People are unequal, not because Hammurabi said so, but because Enlil and Marduk decreed it. People are equal, not because Thomas Jefferson said so, but because God created them that way. Free markets are the best economic system, not because Adam Smith said so, but because these are the immutable laws of nature.”

'“Even what people take to be their most personal desires are usually programmed by the imagined order. Let’s consider, for example, the popular desire to take a holiday abroad. There is nothing natural or obvious about this. A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using his power in order to go on holiday into the territory of a neighbouring chimpanzee band. The elite of ancient Egypt spent their fortunes building pyramids and having their corpses mummified, but none of them thought of going shopping in Babylon or taking a skiing holiday in Phoenicia. People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad because they are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism.”

“A wealthy man in ancient Egypt would never have dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. Instead, he might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted.”

“about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species. From sunrise to sunset humans sowed seeds, watered plants, plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime pastures. This work, they thought, would provide them with more fruit, grain and meat. It was a revolution in the way humans lived – the Agricultural Revolution”

“Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley. No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years. If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of ancient farmers”

“The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.2

Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.

Think for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world.”

“Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants. It wasn’t easy. Wheat demanded a lot of them. Wheat didn’t like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing fields. Wheat didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so men and women laboured long days weeding under the scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out for worms and blight. Wheat was defenceless against other organisms that liked to eat it, from rabbits to locust swarms, so the farmers had to guard and protect it. Wheat was thirsty, so humans lugged water from springs and streams to water it. Its hunger even impelled Sapiens to collect animal faeces to nourish the ground in which wheat grew.”

“Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.”

“Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially”

“The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies”

“As more effort was directed towards cereal cultivation, there was less time to gather and hunt wild species. The foragers became farmers.”

“Whenever they decided to do a bit of extra work – say, to hoe the fields instead of scattering seeds on the surface – people thought, ‘Yes, we will have to work harder. But the harvest will be so bountiful! We won’t have to worry any more about lean years. Our children will never go to sleep hungry.’ It made sense. If you worked harder, you would have a better life. That was the plan.

The first part of the plan went smoothly. People indeed worked harder. But people did not foresee that the number of children would increase, meaning that the extra wheat would have to be shared between more children. Neither did the early farmers understand that feeding children with more porridge and less breast milk would weaken their immune system, and that permanent settlements would be hotbeds for infectious diseases. They did not foresee that by increasing their dependence on a single source of food, they were actually exposing themselves even more to the depredations of drought. Nor did the farmers foresee that in good years their bulging granaries would tempt thieves and enemies, compelling them to start building walls and doing guard duty.

“How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away”

“One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it.”

“The natural lifespan of wild chickens is about seven to twelve years, and of cattle about twenty to twenty-five years. In the wild, most chickens and cattle died long before that, but they still had a fair chance of living for a respectable number of years. In contrast, the vast majority of domesticated chickens and cattle are slaughtered at the age of between a few weeks and a few months, because this has always been the optimal slaughtering age from an economic perspective. (Why keep feeding a cock for three years if it has already reached its maximum weight after three months?)”

“The dairy industry has its own ways of forcing animals to do its will. Cows, goats and sheep produce milk only after giving birth to calves, kids and lambs, and only as long as the youngsters are suckling. To continue a supply of animal milk, a farmer needs to have calves, kids or lambs for suckling, but must prevent them from monopolising the milk. One common method throughout history was to simply slaughter the calves and kids shortly after birth, milk the mother for all she was worth, and then get her pregnant again. This is still a very widespread technique. In many modern dairy farms a milk cow usually lives for about five years before being slaughtered. During these five years she is almost constantly pregnant, and is fertilised within 60 to 120 days after giving birth in order to preserve maximum milk production. Her calves are separated from her shortly after birth. The females are reared to become the next generation of dairy cows, whereas the males are handed over to the care of the meat industry”

“Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the last of its kind. The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures.

This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.”

About why all large animals in Australia died as soon as humans appeared in Australia. “Large animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction – breed slowly. Pregnancy is long, offspring per pregnancy are few, and there are long breaks between pregnancies. Consequently, if humans cut down even one diprotodon every few months, it would be enough to cause diprotodon deaths to”. “the Australian giants had no time to learn to run away. Humans don’t come across as particularly dangerous. They don’t have long, sharp teeth or muscular, lithe bodies. So when a diprotodon, the largest marsupial ever to walk the earth, set eyes for the first time on this frail-looking ape, he gave it one glance and then went back to chewing leaves. These animals had to evolve a fear of humankind, but before they could do so they were gone” Excerpt From Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind Yuval Noah Harari This material may be protected by copyright. outnumber births. Within a few thousand years the last, lonesome diprotodon would pass away, and with her the entire species”.

“At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200 genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over fifty kilograms. At the time of the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained. Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools”

“Why, for example, do people gorge on high-calorie food that is doing little good to their bodies? Today’s affluent societies are in the throes of a plague of obesity, which is rapidly spreading to developing countries. It’s a puzzle why we binge on the sweetest and greasiest food we can find, until we consider the eating habits of our forager forebears. In the savannahs and forests they inhabited, high-calorie sweets were extremely rare and food in general was in short supply. A typical forager 30,000 years ago had access to only one type of sweet food – ripe fruit. If a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot, before the local baboon band picked the tree bare. The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes”

“the average forager had wider, deeper and more varied knowledge of her immediate surroundings than most of her modern descendants. Today, most people in industrial societies don’t need to know much about the natural world in order to survive. What do you really need to know in order to get by as a computer engineer, an insurance agent, a history teacher or a factory worker? You need to know a lot about your own tiny field of expertise, but for the vast majority of life’s necessities you rely blindly on the help of other experts, whose own knowledge is also limited to a tiny field of expertise. The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history”

“While people in today’s affluent societies work an average of forty to forty-five hours a week, and people in the developing world work sixty and even eighty hours a week, hunter-gatherers living today in the most inhospitable of habitats – such as the Kalahari Desert work on average for just thirty-five to forty-five hours a week. They hunt only one day out of three, and gathering takes up just three to six hours daily. In normal times, this is enough to feed the band. It may well be that ancient hunter-gatherers living in zones more fertile than the Kalahari spent even less time obtaining food and raw materials. On top of that, foragers enjoyed a lighter load of household chores. They had no dishes to wash, no carpets to vacuum, no floors to polish, no nappies to change and no bills to pay.”

“The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet. Farmers tend to eat a very limited and unbalanced diet. Especially in premodern times, most of the calories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop – such as wheat, potatoes or rice – that lacks some of the vitamins, minerals and other nutritional materials humans need. The typical peasant in traditional China ate rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, and rice for dinner. If she were lucky, she could expect to eat the same on the following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of different foodstuffs. The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits, snails and turtle for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrows menu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients”

“Ancient foragers also suffered less from infectious diseases. Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies (such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural Revolution. Ancient foragers, who had domesticated only dogs, were free of these scourges. Moreover, most people in agricultural and industrial societies lived in dense, unhygienic permanent settlements – ideal hotbeds for disease. Foragers roamed the land in small bands that could not sustain epidemics”

“Biologists classify organisms into species. Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile offspring. Horses and donkeys have a recent common ancestor and share many physical traits. But they show little sexual interest in one another. They will mate if induced to do so – but their offspring, called mules, are sterile. Mutations in donkey DNA can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice versa. The two types of animals are consequently considered two distinct species, moving along separate evolutionary paths. By contrast, a bulldog and a spaniel may look very different, but they are members of the same species, sharing the same DNA pool. They will happily mate and their puppies will grow up to pair off with other dogs and produce more puppies”

“The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. It’s not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull. It’s even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of food. Secondly, their muscles atrophied. Like a government diverting money from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps to neurons. It’s hardly a foregone conclusion that this is a good strategy for survival on the savannah. A chimpanzee can’t win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.”

“Another singular human trait is that we walk upright on two legs. Standing up, it’s easier to scan the savannah for game or enemies, and arms that are unnecessary for locomotion are freed for other purposes, like throwing stones or signalling. The more things these hands could do, the more successful their owners were. Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands with backaches and stiff necks. Women paid extra. An upright gait required narrower hips, constricting the birth canal – and this just when babies’ heads were getting bigger and bigger. Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females. Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education. This fact has contributed greatly both to humankind’s extraordinary social abilities and to its unique social problems. Lone mothers could hardly forage enough food for their offspring and themselves with needy children in tow. Raising children required constant help from other family members and neighbours. It takes a tribe to raise a human. Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming strong social ties. In addition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialised to a far greater extent than any other animal"

“One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was our original niche. Just as woodpeckers specialise in extracting insects from the trunks of trees, the first humans specialised in extracting marrow from bones. Why marrow? Well, suppose you observe a pride of lions take down and devour a giraffe. You wait patiently until they’re done. But it’s still not your turn because first the hyenas and jackals – and you don’t dare interfere with them scavenge the leftovers. Only then would you and your band dare approach the carcass, look cautiously left and right – and dig into the edible tissue that remained.

This is a key to understanding our history and psychology. Genus Homo’s position in the food chain was, until quite recently, solidly in the middle. For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they could, all the while being hunted by larger predators. It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis, and only in the last 100,000 years – with the rise of Homo sapiens – that man jumped to the top of the food chain. That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences. Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years.”

“the best thing fire did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms – such as wheat, rice and potatoes – became staples of our diet thanks to cooking. Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, it changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects and carrion if they were cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens” Excerpt From Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind Yuval Noah Harari This material may be protected by copyright.

“Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.”

“The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies support it. Even today the vast majority of human communication – whether in the form of emails, phone calls or newspaper columns – is gossip. It comes so naturally to us that it seems as if our language evolved for this very purpose. Do you think that history professors chat about the reasons for World War One when they meet for lunch, or that nuclear physicists spend their coffee breaks at scientific conferences talking about quarks? Sometimes. But more often, they gossip about the professor who caught her husband cheating, or the quarrel between the head of the department and the dean, or the rumours that a colleague used his research funds to buy a Lexus. Gossip usually focuses on wrongdoings. Rumour-mongers are the original fourth estate, journalists who inform society about and thus protect it from cheats and freeloaders.”

“it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.

Legends, myths, gods and religions appeared for the first time with the Cognitive Revolution. Many animals and human species could previously say, ‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our tribe.’ This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language”

“fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively. We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Ants and bees can also work together in huge numbers, but they do so in a very rigid manner and only with close relatives. Wolves and chimpanzees cooperate far more flexibly than ants, but they can do so only with small numbers of other individuals that they know intimately. Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.”

“In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens to form larger and more stable bands. But even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings.

Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around this magic number. Below this threshold, communities, businesses, social networks and military units can maintain themselves based mainly on intimate acquaintance and rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles and law books to keep order”

“How exactly did Armand Peugeot, the man, create Peugeot, the company? In much the same way that priests and sorcerers have created gods and demons throughout history, and in which thousands of French curés were still creating Christ’s body every Sunday in the parish churches. It all revolved around telling stories, and convincing people to believe them”

“Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals. Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions”

“The kinds of things that people create through this network of stories are known in academic circles as ‘fictions’, ‘social constructs’, or ‘imagined realities’.”

“Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world”

“Most millionaires sincerely believe in the existence of money and limited liability companies. Most human-rights activists sincerely believe in the existence of human rights. No one was lying when, in 2011, the UN demanded that the Libyan government respect the human rights of its citizens, even though the UN, Libya and human rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations.

Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations.”

The Cortex(behind forehead) and the Amygdala(at the centre of head) -- are the two pathways (sources) of anxiety

“The amygdala is located near the center of the brain (see figure 1). As previously stated, the brain actually has two amygdalas, one in the left hemisphere and one in the right; but it’s customary to refer to the amygdala as singular, so we’ll continue this practice”

“The amygdala is the source of many of our emotional reactions, both positive and negative. When someone violates your personal space or gets in your face, it’s the amygdala that produces the rage you feel. On the other hand, when you meet someone who looks like your grandmother and you experience a warm feeling of affection for this lady you don’t even know, that’s also the amygdala, in this case accessing a pleasant emotional memory. The amygdala both forms and recalls emotional memories; and if you understand this, your emotional reactions will probably make much more sense to you”

“As you can see, one clear distinction between the amygdala and the cortex is that they operate on different timetables. The amygdala can cause you to act on information sooner than your cortex can process it, orchestrating a bodily response before the cortex has even finished organizing the information for you to perceive it. While this is beneficial in some situations, the fact that we have little control over the amygdala’s rapid responses means that we experience our fear and anxiety responses, rather than consciously controlling them.”

“The quick reaction that results from the amygdala pathway is typically called the fight-or-flight response”

“When you’re experiencing the fight, flight, or freeze response, the amygdala is in the driver’s seat and you’re a passenger. That’s why, in emergency situations, you often feel as though you’re observing yourself responding rather than consciously controlling your response. There’s a reason why we don’t feel in control in these moments, or in control of our anxiety: the amygdala isn’t just faster—it also has the neurological capability to override other brain processes”

“You know that the cortex pathway produces worries, obsessions, and interpretations that create anxiety, and you know that the amygdala initiates bodily reactions that make up the fight, flight, or freeze response.”

“The circuitry in your brain is shaped by the specific experiences you’ve had, and it can be changed as a result of your continuing experiences. For example, connections between particular neurons are strengthened when you use them. Some of us continue to use our memories of multiplication tables to calculate math equations, and those connections remain as strong as when we were in school. But some of us rely on calculators, so we don’t regularly use the brain circuits storing the multiplication tables, and our memory of these tables weakens.”

“The specific circuitry in your brain develops based on the experiences you have. Perhaps your brain came to associate horses with stables, grandfathers with cigars, the smell of popcorn with baseball, and so on. Although two people may share similar associations, each of us has uniquely formed brain circuits based on our own experiences. While one person may have circuitry that associates cows with cheese and Wisconsin, another person may have circuitry that associates cows with barns and milking machines.”

“In fact, evidence suggests that amygdala-based memory is longer lasting than cortex-based memory (LeDoux 2000). In other words, the cortex is much more likely than the amygdala to forget information or have trouble retrieving it”

“If you fear a specific object or situation, you may be able to recall an experience in which your amygdala learned that fear. Alternatively, it may be difficult to uncover how an amygdala-based fear developed, since your cortex isn’t able to retrieve a memory related to that situation, even though the amygdala clearly does. The fact that the cortex can be left out of the loop is why people are often confused by their emotional responses.”

“Realizing that your amygdala stores emotional memories that your cortex has no knowledge of can help you better understand some of your emotional reactions”

“Two pathways can create anxiety. One pathway travels the detail-focused circuitry of the cortex and eventually sends information to the amygdala, which produces an anxiety response. The other pathway runs directly from the thalamus to the amygdala. Each pathway can cause the amygdala to create anxiety, but each is also constructed of circuitry, and certain aspects of that circuitry can be modified”

“To understand amygdala-based anxiety, it’s useful to think of the amygdala as your protector. Natural selection has given humans a fear-producing amygdala that has protection as a central goal. As you go about your day, the amygdala is vigilant for anything that might indicate potential harm”

“The truth is, the cortex often comes up with reasons for our behaviors, which may or may not be accurate explanations.”

“In addition, the amygdala quickly adds various flaming objects to its list of dangerous things to avoid, so the child may also fear lighters, sparklers, and campfires. The amygdala retains lasting memories that identify the object and similar objects as dangerous.”

“After this connection has been created, you’ll feel anxious whenever the amygdala recognizes similar sensory information. The sights, sounds, or smells associated with the negative event become capable of activating the amygdala’s alarm system. The term trigger refers to anything—an event, object, sound, smell, and so on—that activates the amygdala’s alarm system as a result of association-based learning. In the example above, dogs become a trigger for anxiety. Triggers are an important aspect of the language of the amygdala”

“For example, you might have a mild dislike of a certain type of food that was associated with a negative experience, such as egg salad that you ate during a stressful family picnic. On the other hand, if you once ate pancakes when you had an illness that later caused you to throw up, you might find that, even years later, just the smell of pancakes makes you nauseous.”

“Before you get the idea that you might be better off without your amygdala, remember that its role is to protect you. In addition, it produces positive emotions due to association-based learning. For example, if your special someone gives you a necklace as a gift, you’ll experience feelings of warmth and love for your partner. Later, when you see the necklace, the association formed between the necklace and the emotion of love will make you experience warm, affectionate feelings again”

“As you can see, amygdala-based emotions aren’t rational. They’re based on associations, not logic”

“Consider Beth, who was sexually assaulted while a specific Rolling Stones song was playing. After the assault, whenever Beth heard the song she felt intense anxiety. Obviously, the Rolling Stones song had nothing to do with the sexual assault; it was just a coincidence that it was playing when the assault occurred. Nonetheless, Beth’s amygdala responded to the association between the song and the assault, an extremely negative event. In this way, the amygdala transforms a neutral object or situation into something that creates an emotional reaction.”

“Well-meaning family members and friends, and sometimes even people struggling with anxiety, often think logic and reason should change the way the anxious person reacts. But, of course, the amygdala isn’t logical”

“As you’ll see later in the book, many cortex-based anxiety symptoms do respond to logical arguments, but when it comes to amygdala-based anxiety, there’s only one sure way for the amygdala to learn: experience.”

“If you want the amygdala to change its response to an object (for example, a mouse) or a situation (such as a noisy crowd), the amygdala needs experience with the object or situation for new learning to occur. Experience is most effective when the person interacts directly with the object or situation, although observing another person has also been shown to affect the amygdala (Olsson, Nearing, and Phelps 2007). You can reason with the amygdala for hours, but if you’re trying to change amygdala-based anxiety, that tactic won’t be as effective as a few minutes of direct experience will be”

“So, to change your amygdala’s fear response to, say, a mouse, you must be in the presence of a mouse in order activate the memory circuits related to mice. Only then can new connections be made. Because the amygdala learns on the basis of associations or pairings, it must experience a change in these pairings for the circuitry to change. Not surprisingly, when your mouse-memory circuits are activated, you’re going to feel some anxiety.

Unfortunately, people typically try to avoid such experiences, and this avoidance prevents the amygdala from forming new connections.”

“When you come to terms with the idea that you need to activate the amygdala’s circuits to generate new associations, you’ve learned an important lesson. We like the pithy phrase “activate to generate” as shorthand for this requirement, which is perhaps the most challenging lesson in the language of the amygdala. It’s challenging because it involves accepting the experience of anxiety as necessary for new learning to occur.”

“You’ve learned that one of the main functions of the amygdala is to protect you, and that the amygdala creates memories that you may not be aware of but experience instead as emotional reactions”

“As the cortex processes this information, it can interpret perfectly safe sensations as threatening. It then sends a message along to the amygdala that can produce anxiety. In this case, the cortex turns a rather neutral experience that wouldn’t naturally activate the amygdala into a threat, causing the amygdala to react by creating an anxiety response”

“Confusing a thought with reality is a very seductive process due to the cortex’s tendency to believe it possesses the real meaning of every thought, emotion, or physical sensation. Actually, the cortex is surprisingly prone to misinterpretations and errors”

“In reality, you need not take every thought or emotion you have seriously. You can allow many thoughts and emotions to simply pass without undue attention or analysis.”

“Although people may believe thinking processes like worry or rumination will lead to a solution, what actually happens is a strengthening of the circuitry in the cortex that produces anxiety. In addition, rumination has been shown to lead to depression”

“Whatever you devote a great deal of time to thinking about or think about in great detail is more likely to be strengthened in your cortex. The circuits in the brain operate on the principle of “survival of the busiest” (Schwartz and Begley 2003, 17), and whatever circuitry you use repetitively is likely to be very easily activated in the future.”

“the cortex can’t produce an anxiety response; the amygdala and other parts of the brain are needed to accomplish that”

“The first step is to recognize when the cortex is producing thoughts or images that may lead to anxiety. When you become aware of these thoughts and their anxiety-inducing effects, you can begin to recognize the thoughts, identify when they occur, and take steps to change them.”

“It’s important to remember that when anxiety begins in the amygdala, cortex-based interventions, such as logic and reasoning, don’t always help reduce anxiety.”

“If, on the other hand, you know that your anxiety began in the cortex, the more effective approach is to change your thoughts and images to decrease the resulting amygdala activation”

“Decreasing the number of times your cortex causes your amygdala to become activated will cut down on your overall anxiety.”

“Many people believe that certain situations are the cause of their anxiety, but anxiety always begins in the brain, not with the situation. Anxiety is a human emotion, produced by the human brain, and emotions are caused by the brain’s reaction to situations, not the situations themselves. People have different reactions to the same event because of their differing interpretations”

“If you were focusing on specific thoughts or images, that suggests your anxiety began in the cortex. If, on the other hand, you feel that a specific object, location, or situation immediately elicited an anxiety response, the amygdala is more likely to be the starting point.”

“When you experience this amygdala-based control of your brain, you’ll feel unable to control your thoughts. Remember, from an evolutionary standpoint the amygdala’s ability to seize control when it detects danger helped our distant ancestors survive. Therefore, the amygdala has retained this capacity. Still, it’s both disconcerting and frustrating to temporarily lose the ability to decide what to focus on or think about”

“In the first half of this chapter, you assessed your tendency to experience cortex-based anxiety and determined whether specific thought processes are contributing to your anxiety. In the second half of the chapter, you assessed whether you’re prone to experiences of amygdala-based anxiety: unexplained anxiety, rapid physiological responding, unplanned aggressive feelings or behavior, inability to think clearly, and extreme responses.”

“The stress response produces a predictable set of physiological changes, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, rapid breathing, dilated pupils, a sudden increase of blood flow to the extremities, slowed digestion, and increased perspiration”

“If you’re suddenly in the midst of a panic attack, there are three amygdala-based coping strategies that will work to calm you down: deep breathing, muscle relaxation, and exercise. They can’t immediately shut down all of the activation that’s been created in your body, but they will reduce your discomfort and shorten the duration of the panic attack.”

“Deep breathing: One of the best things to do when you’re having a panic attack is to breathe slowly. Some of the symptoms of panic attacks, such as tingling or dizziness, are directly related to hyperventilation, or breathing too quickly. Taking slow, full, deep breaths that extend your chest and diaphragm outward is a good start. (The diaphragm is a muscle that extends across the torso beneath the lungs.) Slow breathing has been shown to decrease activation in the amygdala.”

“Exercise: We encourage you to pace or exercise during a panic attack. This will burn off the excess adrenaline that’s in your system and should help shorten the panic attack. Remember, your body is prepared to fight or flee, so physical exertion is exactly what your body is ready to do.”

“One final and extremely important point: When you feel panicky, it’s important to resist the strong urge to flee the situation. While it’s an extremely frightening and unpleasant experience, a panic attack won’t physically hurt you. In fact, the sensations you’re experiencing are signs of a healthy, reactive body. Escaping the situation may make you feel better in the short term, but in the long run it will reinforce the power of panic attacks and make them more difficult to overcome. If possible, try to relax, breathe deeply, and remain in the situation.”

“If you leave the situation, your amygdala will learn to escape the situation rather than learning that the situation is safe”

“Recognizing that you’re experiencing a panic attack and nothing more, and not buying into the cortex’s misinterpretation of your amygdala-based symptoms, will help you recover more quickly.”

“Let go of concerns about what others are thinking: People who have panic attacks often believe that everyone is looking at them or that they’ll somehow embarrass themselves. If you feel symptoms of panic, try not to let your cortex guess what other people may be thinking.”

“Although the preceding tips may be helpful for preventing panic attacks, the efficacy of cortex-based approaches is limited once a true panic attack begins. In a full-blown panic attack, you’re likely to be too anxious to think clearly because the amygdala is taking charge and shutting out the influence of your cortex. At such times, the only solution is to breathe slowly, try to relax, and distract yourself as you wait for the attack to pass”

“Under no circumstances should you listen to people who tell you that it’s all in your head or you should just get over it. Panic attacks are caused by an overreaction of the amygdala. They’re a biological reality, and you can’t reason yourself out of them using your cortex”

“Find something active you can do, even if it’s just calling someone on the phone. In fact, social activities that involve enjoyable interactions with others, or simple pleasurable activities that distract you from your worries, can keep your amygdala from creating responses characterized by freezing, avoidance, and immobilization.”

“although we don’t consciously control our rate of breathing most of the time, we can deliberately modify it if we choose to do so. A variety of techniques have been developed for activating the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which reverses many of the effects the central nucleus creates by activating the SNS. As mentioned in chapter 1, whereas activation of the SNS creates the fight, flight, or freeze response, the action of the PNS is often referred to as “rest and digest.” It slows heart rate and increases secretion of gastric juices and insulin as well as activity of the intestines.”

“Take a deep breath, making a point of expanding your lungs as you inhale deeply and slowly. Don’t hold your breath. Allow yourself to exhale naturally. Some people feel a reduction in anxiety almost immediately when they do this for several minutes. Merely altering your breathing and adopting a slow rhythm of deep breathing can be soothing and relieve stress.”

“People who are hyperventilating are often instructed to deliberately slow their breathing or breathe into a paper bag. The bag captures carbon dioxide when they exhale; therefore, breathing in from the bag increases the amount of carbon dioxide inhaled and replaced in the bloodstream. It’s a very effective method of reversing light-headedness and other anxiety symptoms”

“To practice diaphragmatic breathing, sit comfortably and place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. Take a deep breath and see which part of your body expands. Effective diaphragmatic breathing will cause your stomach to expand as you inhale and retract as you exhale. Your chest shouldn’t move much at all”

“Also try to notice times when you’re holding your breath, breathing shallowly, or hyperventilating, and then make a deliberate effort to adopt a better breathing pattern. Breathing is an essential bodily response that you can control, and in the process, you can reduce amygdala activation and its effects. With”

“Clearly, it’s an effective relaxation strategy, and we’ve spoken to many people who find that incorporating regular meditation into their morning routine decreases their overall anxiety and helps them feel more prepared to cope with the demands of the day.”

“If you practice relaxation techniques routinely, eventually they will become second nature and help decrease your general anxiety level.”

“We learn to fear triggers that are associated with negative events, whether or not a trigger actually causes a negative experience. When a trigger is paired with a negative event, the amygdala is programmed to produce anxiety”

“In the language of the amygdala, the pairing of a trigger with a negative event is very powerful. Thinking processes from the cortex, like logic and reasoning, are of little use when dealing with fear and anxiety in the amygdala.”

“A crowd is just a crowd, an elevator is just an elevator, and so on. These things become triggers when an emotional memory is made, whether with anxiety, happiness, or even affection.”

“As you can see, the Anxiety-Provoking Situations Worksheet is extremely useful for identifying the situations you’d like to target for change. Identifying your triggers in these situations will help you know what you need to teach your amygdala. It isn’t necessary to change your reactions to all your triggers. Rather, choose to target triggers in those situations in which your anxiety stands in the way of your personal goals and dreams, those that result in the greatest distress, or those you encounter most frequently.”

“Repeated exposure to a seemingly threatening situation without anything negative occurring can teach the amygdala that the situation doesn’t require a fearful response. You can overcome fears if you give your amygdala experiences that teach it to feel safe in related situations. This is the power of exposure”

“But ultimately, they must directly experience the situation, usually repeatedly. Obviously, this is a challenging form of treatment, but research shows that it’s exactly the approach needed to rewire the amygdala”

“You must experience fear or anxiety in order to conquer it. There’s more than cowboy wisdom in the old adage “You gotta get back on the horse that threw you.”

“An analogy may help you remember how important it is to activate the circuitry of anxiety, even though this is an uncomfortable experience. When you’re making a cup of tea, you’ll have better results if the water is hot. Putting tea leaves or a tea bag in a cup of cold water won’t be as effective in allowing the flavor of the tea to be infused into the water. In a similar way, your neural circuits need to be activated (or hot) to make new connections. When it comes to anxiety, you need to be exposed to the heat if you want to rewire your neural circuitry.”

“There’s no way to change the circuitry the lateral nucleus has created without giving the amygdala new experiences with a cat and, as a consequence, creating some anxiety. In fact, the child’s anxiety is a good indication that the correct circuits in the amygdala have been activated and are ready for new learning.”

“Have you ever dipped your toes into a pool or lake and winced at the cool temperature of the water? As you wade further in, you’re aware of the coolness of the water as it gradually reaches your stomach and chest. After a period of time, however, your body adjusts, and you find yourself comfortable in the water. You smile at others who are in just up to their knees and complaining that it’s cold.”

“So, for example, if you’re trying to get over a fear of elevators, the most effective approach is to ride a variety of elevators in different settings.”

“Remember, courage is not the absence of fear; courage is acting despite fear. The more you experience anxiety and stay in the situation long enough for your fear to diminish, the stronger the new circuitry will become.”

“Your amygdala needs to learn that it’s safe and that escape isn’t necessary. Remember, this is something you must show the amygdala; it only learns through experience”

“The more you’re limited by your anxiety, the more frequently you’ll need to practice exposure in order to regain control of your life. Also, make sure you plan in advance. If you don’t schedule your exposures and plan to repeat them, you won’t rewire your brain and reduce your anxiety.”

“As a reminder, don’t leave the situation while your fear is still high. If you flee and then feel relief, you’ll teach your amygdala that escape is the answer. This will only increase your anxiety in the future”

“The most important element of exposure therapy is practice, practice, practice. The only way the amygdala learns is through experience. At times it’s going to be upsetting, even daunting. But if you really want to overcome your anxiety, you need to do this difficult work. Remember, it’s a “no pain, no gain” proposition.”

“Exercise has surprisingly powerful effects on the amygdala, surpassing many antianxiety medications in effectiveness. Sleep also has a strong impact on the amygdala’s functioning, with lack of sleep leading to heightened anxiety.”

“And as you learned in chapter 6, relaxing your muscles can help ease anxiety. If you run or walk briskly when you feel anxious, you’ll make use of muscles that have been prepared for action. This will lower levels of adrenaline and use up glucose released into the bloodstream by the stress response. And after you exercise, you’ll experience substantial, long-lasting muscle relaxation”

“We highly recommend exercise as a strategy for reducing anxiety because, quite simply, it works. A variety of studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise can ease anxiety (Conn 2010; DeBoer et al. 2012). Reductions in anxiety”

“Generally, exercise results in decreased muscle tension for at least an hour and a half afterward, and reductions in anxiety last from four to six hours”

“Exercise doesn’t just reduce anxiety in the moment or for a few hours afterward. Research shows that following a regular exercise program for at least ten weeks can reduce people’s general level of anxiety”

“This finding indicates, once again, that the effects of exercise on the brain last much longer than duration of the exercise period and may in fact persist for days. It’s quite possible that when you exercise, you’re raising your endorphin level not just for that day, but for days afterward.”

“For example, after running on a treadmill for thirty minutes, men showed greater activation in the left frontal cortex compared to the right frontal area (Petruzzello and Landers 1994). Greater left frontal activation has been associated with a more positive mood, suggesting that exercise can stimulate the cortex in a manner that produces more positive feelings. Those positive feelings are likely to help reduce anxiety”

“So be aware that if you’re going without sleep, you’re making it more likely that your amygdala will be reactive and cause you to experience anxiety or other emotional reactions, such as anger and irritability.”

“four hours of sleep followed by an hour of wakefulness and then another four hours of sleep isn’t equal to eight hours of sleep. When you return to sleep after being awake for even just half an hour, the sleep cycles start over from the beginning, so it will take many more hours to get through an entire sleep period. It isn’t like returning to watching a movie where you left off. It’s like having to go through the whole movie again from the beginning.”

“As you’ve seen in this chapter, when it comes to reducing anxiety, exercise and sleep can benefit both the cortex and the amygdala”

“when thoughts or images in the cortex have initiated the anxiety response, changing those thoughts or images can definitely ease or prevent anxiety”

“Consider two teenagers waiting for their driver’s exams to be scored. Jose sat worrying about whether he’d passed, doubting his answers, and imagining being told that he couldn’t get his license. Meanwhile, Ricardo’s father joked around with him after he took his exam, which kept Ricardo from focusing on possibly failing. Thanks to his father’s distracting antics, Ricardo didn’t think about potential negative outcomes. As it turned out, both passed the test, but only Jose had endured a stressful, anxious waiting period. When people change their thoughts, they may be able to prevent cortex-based processes from contributing to their anxiety”

“Of course, whenever we try to change our thoughts, we’re trying to modify the cortex in some way. Our thoughts are not simply a result of neurological and chemical processes in the brain; they are the neurological and chemical processes in the brain. In cognitive restructuring, the thoughts you think are used to rewire your brain.”

“when thoughts or images in the cortex have initiated the anxiety response, changing those thoughts or images can definitely ease or prevent anxiety”

“Josh doesn’t show up for a dinner date with Monique and Jayden. Jayden is furious at Josh and expresses her anger. Monique, on the other hand, isn’t too concerned and simply wants to enjoy her time with Jayden, whom she hasn’t seen in weeks. The event is the same for both women: Josh doesn’t show up. But their interpretations are obviously quite different. Jayden’s interpretation might be Josh should follow through when he says he’s coming or He doesn’t have any respect for us, leading to her reaction of anger. In contrast, Monique has a different interpretation: This is an opportunity to spend time alone with my friend Jayden.”
